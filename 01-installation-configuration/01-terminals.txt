Physical and Pseudo Terminals

	CTRL + ALT + Fn (where n in 1..7) -> change to physical terminals. 7th is the graphical one. 
	tty 				  -> shows the current physical or pseudo terminal
	who 				  -> shows all terminals 
	w 				  -> presents a more detailed view about the terminals than 'who'
	sudo chvt n (where n in 1..7) 	  -> change to physical terminals.

	OBS.: ssh opens pseudo terminals
