Swap file systems

	Disk Partition (Swap Partition)
	Swap File


Managing swap partitions

	swapon -s			-> shows swap usage summary. Equivalent to /proc/swaps
	free				-> shows memory information, which includes swap usage
	gdisk DEVICE			-> can be used to create the swap partition (fdisk or parted could be used as well)
	> n				-> creates a new partition into the selected device
	> Hex Code or GUID		-> 8200 (Linux Swap partition type)
	> w				-> write changes to the partition table
	mkwsap DEVICE			-> builds the swap file system
	swapon DEVICE			-> enables the swap system
	swapoff DEVICE			-> disables the swap system
	swapon -p PRIORITY DEVICE	-> enables the swap device with the given priority
					   partition with highest priority is used first. When it reaches the maximum memory, the next partition
					   with highest priority is used
					   if there are partitions with the same priority, they are used simultaneously

	OBS.: If the creation of the partition requires reboot, "partprobe DEVICE" can be used instead, forcing the sincronization of the created
	      partition and the memory

	      /proc/partitions can be queried to list partition information

	      To auto-mount the swap file system during boot time, it's necessary to include the partition configuration into /etc/fstab
	      "swapon -a" acts like "mount -a", but for swap file system, mounting unmounted file system defined on /etc/fstab


Managing swap files (can be used when swap need is temporary, like when more memory is necessary to finish an specific project)

	dd if=/dev/zero of=OUT_FILE_PATH count=1000 bs=1024	-> creates image file to the swap file system
	mkswap OUT_FILE_PATH					-> build the swap file system as the output file
	swapon OUT_FILE_PATH					-> mounts the swap file system
