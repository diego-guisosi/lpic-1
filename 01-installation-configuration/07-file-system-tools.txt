	df -hT				 	-> shows file system usage in human readable format, including the type of the file system
	df -hlT				 	-> hides mapped (network) file systems. Displays only local file systems
	du -h DIR			 	-> shows disk usage of the provided directory and it subdirectories in human readable format
	du -hs DIR			 	-> shows disk usage only of the provided directory. Does not display subdirectories usage
	dump2efs DEVICE 		 	-> dump information about extN file systems
	dd OPERAND...			 	-> copy file, according to the provided operands

			   		 	dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/master_boot_record count=1 bs=512
							copies first 512 bytes (master boot record) of the device /dev/sda to /tmp/master_boot_record
			   		 	dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda count=1 bs=512
							replaces first 512 bytes (master boot record) with zeros (removes MBR)
							if fdisk -l /dev/sda is executed after that, the partition table will not be presented
			   		 	dd if=/tmp/master_boot_record of=/dev/sda count=1 bs=512
							copies the master boot record back to the device /dev/sda
							if fdisk -l /dev/sda is executed after that, the partition table is presented again

	tune2fs				 	-> set parameters on extN file systems
	debugfs				 	-> file system debugger. Can be used, among other things, to possibly undelete files
	extundelete --inode INODE DEVICE 	-> shows information about the inode of the given device
	extundelete --restore-file FILE DEVICE	-> restore the deleted FILE of the given DEVICE
						   file path must be relative to the mount point

	OBS.: "ls -li" can be used to list the inode of the files
