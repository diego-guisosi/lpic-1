Physical and Pseudo Terminals

	CTRL + ALT + Fn (where n in 1..7) -> change to physical terminals. 7th is the graphical one. 
	tty 				  -> shows the current physical or pseudo terminal
	who 				  -> shows all terminals 
	w 				  -> presents a more detailed view about the terminals than 'who'
	sudo chvt n (where n in 1..7) 	  -> change to physical terminals.

	OBS.: ssh opens pseudo terminals


Resource Usage

	uptime	-> shows how much time the system has been running
	free	-> presents how much memory is free
	lsusb	-> list devices connected to usb bus
	lsscsi	-> list devices connected to scsi bus
	lspci	-> list devices connected to pci bus
	uname	-> shows kernel information
	hwinfo	-> shows information about all hardware

	OBS.: 'which' can be used when it is necessary to know the complete path for a given command


Pseudo File Systems (in-memory information about the hardware)

	/sys	-> contains metadata about the devices
	/dev	-> contains links to physical devices thenselfs
	/proc	-> information about the system

	OBS.: /proc/interrupts shows runtime interrupts happening on OS
	      most commands extract data from these pseudo file systems
