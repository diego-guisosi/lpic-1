Copying/moving files

	cp SOURCE TARGET		-> Copies source file to TARGET, which can be a directory or a file name
	cp -i SOURCE TARGET		-> Copies source file to TARGET. If the file already exists on TARGET, a confirmation message is prompted
	cp -a SOURCE TARGET		-> Copies source file to TARGET, mantaining file permissions and ownership.
					   Useful option when copying files as root.
	cp -R SOURCE TARGET		-> Recursively copies source directory to target directory, copying all of subdirectories contents.

	mv SOURCE TARGET		-> Moves source file to TARGET. If target is a file name within the same directory, source file is renamed to target

	Obs.: GLOB pattern can be used to copy or move files.
		file* = file followed by 0 or any amount of characters
		file? = file followed by a single character


Removing files and directories

	rm FILE			-> Removes the provided file
	rm -i FILE		-> Removes in interactive mode, displaying confirmation messages for each file to be deleted
	rm -rf DIR		-> Removes the provided directory and its contents
	
	rmdir DIR		-> Removes DIR if it is empty


Directory listings

	ls			-> Lists current directory
	ls DIR			-> Lists content of DIR
	ls -d DIR		-> Lists DIR without presenting its contents
	ls -l DIR		-> Lists content of DIR in long list format (presents file permissions, ownership, target of symbolic links etc.)
	ls -F DIR		-> Lists content of DIR with an indicator appended to the file name determining the kind of file
	ls -lt DIR		-> Lists content of DIR by modification time
	ls -ltr DIR		-> Lists content of DIR by modification time in reverse order

	Obs.: readlink SYMBOLIC_LINK can be used to display the target of the symbolic link
	      
	     "ls" is usually configured with alias, so that the prefered options are always executed
	      e.g: alias ls='ls --color=auto'
	     
	     "alias" without parameters lists configured aliases

	     \COMMAND runs the original COMMAND, even if there is an alias configured


Imaging disks (duplicate disks)

	dd if=/dev/sda of=/root/mbr count=1 bs=512	-> copies first 512 bytes from /dev/sda (Master Boot Record) to /root/mbr
	dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/root/boot.img		-> copies entire /dev/sda1 partition to the image file /root/boot.img


Synchronizing directories

	rsync -av SOURCE TARGET				-> Synchonizes files from SOURCE to TARGET, copying only the files not already present on TARGET.
							   -a (archive mode) keeps permissions and ownership of the files
							   -v (verbose)
	rsync -av USER@HOST:SOURCE TARGET		-> The same as above, but synchronizes remote directories with local directories
	rsync -av SOURCE USER@HOST:TARGET		-> The same as above, but synchronizes local directories with remote directories


Archiving files

	tar -cvf TARGET_FILE SOURCE_DIR			-> Creates an archive file TARGET_FILE containing the contents of SOURCE_DIR
	tar -czvf TARGET_FILE SOURCE_DIR		-> Creates a gzip compressed archive file containing the contents of SOURCE_DIR
	tar -cjvf TARGET_FILE SOURCE_DIR		-> Creates a bzip2 compressed archive file containing the contents of SOURCE_DIR

	file FILE					-> determines the file type. Can be used to verify which compression algorithm was used with tar

	tar -tvf FILE					-> lists contents of the archive

	tar -xvf FILE					-> expands the archive, bringing its contents back to the current directory
	tar -xzvf FILE					-> expands gzip compressed archive
	tar -xjvf FILE					-> expands bzip2 compressed archive


Searching files

	find DIR -newer FILE			-> searches for files from DIR newer than FILE
	find DIR -size +138k			-> searches for files from DIR whose size is greater than 138k
	find DIR -newer FILE -type f -delete    -> deletes regular files from DIR newer than FILE
	find DIR -newer FILE -exec ls -lh {} \;	-> lists in human readable format files from DIR newer than FILE
						   {} is a placeholder for the matched result
						   \; represents the end of the instruction (line)
